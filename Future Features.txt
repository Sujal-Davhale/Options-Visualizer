To add:

To Test:
1. use 444 spreads

Later:
1. Add time to maturity for each call/put --> 
    Call the top box "Time to Mat for Graph"
    have a check box that has "use for options" -- default is ticked
    if not ticked --> have individual time to mat for each call/put
        remove bonds from the list of securities as idk what math to use on that
    
    Use time to mat for graph as the period for the calendar spread
        make sure to note next to check box that this means you are making a calendar spread

2. Add default premium according to black scholes
    Use default interest rate --> 5%?
    Use prev day close VIX for market volatility (might need back end for APIs)
    Make sure to mention this in the assumptions


3. Add "Real Value" graph
    Uses American Option as example, sets the Graph view to "Value Today"
    Uses more fancy formula to calculate value of call/put/bond
